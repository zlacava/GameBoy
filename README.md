## Current Status
IN PROGRESS

## Project Overview

This device would be able to simulate multiple games that all have relatively simple inputs and outputs. The user should be able to decide which game they want by way of a specified input.

## Educational Value Added

Completing this project would help me learn about the process of integrating programming with circuit design which I've wanted to learn about since I have a lot of experience and background in both circuit design and programming, but never truly combined the two. This would also help educate me on programmable micro-controllers which I have been very interested in learning about.
